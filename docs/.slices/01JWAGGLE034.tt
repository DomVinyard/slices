# Session: The Squirrel Problem

## Context

We've had 17 incidents in the past month of dogs reacting aggressively to squirrels seen through car windows. Two dogs attempted to exit moving vehicles. No injuries (yet), but this is a safety issue.

---

**David (Driver Ops):** We need to talk about squirrels.

**Agent:** I saw the incident reports. Let me pull the data.

[Tool: search incident reports for "squirrel"]

```
Incident Summary (Past 30 Days)
-------------------------------
Total squirrel-related incidents: 17
- Excessive barking: 12
- Attempted window exit: 3
- Attempted door exit: 2
- Successful escape: 0 (thankfully)

Breeds most affected:
- Terriers: 7 incidents
- Hounds: 4 incidents
- Retrievers: 3 incidents
- Other: 3 incidents

Times:
- Morning (6-10am): 11 incidents
- Afternoon (2-6pm): 6 incidents
```

**Tom:** The terrier numbers don't surprise me. They were literally bred to chase small animals.

**David:** The two door exit attempts are what scare me. Drivers reported the dogs were pawing at door handles.

**Agent:** Let me understand the current safeguards:

1. Child locks engaged (prevents handle from working)
2. Power windows locked by driver
3. Driver training mentions "distraction management"

But there's no proactive squirrel mitigation. Ideas:

### Proposed: Squirrel Mode

**1. Window Tinting / Shades**
- Deployable window shades in back seats
- Reduces external visibility during high-risk periods
- Trade-off: Dogs might enjoy looking outside

**2. Squirrel Detection**
- Camera-based system to detect squirrels near route
- Alert driver to engage calming measures
- Ambitious, probably v2

**3. Calming Response Protocol**

When driver reports squirrel sighting:
```
1. Auto-dispense treat (distraction)
2. Play calming music
3. Driver verbal reassurance script
4. Log incident for pattern learning
```

**4. High-Risk Route Avoidance**
- Learn which routes have high squirrel density
- Avoid during peak squirrel hours (morning)
- Trade-off: Might add time to rides

**David:** I like the calming protocol. Can we also add this to driver training?

**Agent:** Yes. Update to driver training:

### Driver Training: Squirrel Management

```
WHEN YOU SEE A SQUIRREL:

1. Stay calm - your energy affects the dog
2. Press "Squirrel Alert" button in app
   - This triggers auto-treat and calming music
3. Use calm voice: "It's okay, buddy. Good dog."
4. If dog is highly agitated:
   - Pull over safely
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Dispense extra treats
5. Do NOT:
   - Point at squirrel
   - Say "squirrel" (dogs know this word)
   - Open windows
```

**Tom:** "Do not say squirrel" - that's important. Dogs definitely know that word.

**Agent:** Should we add a bark-pattern detector for squirrel-excitement barks? The ML model could learn to distinguish "I want a ride" barks from "SQUIRREL" barks.

**David:** That might be useful for automatic squirrel mode activation. If we detect squirrel bark, auto-engage calming protocol.

**Agent:** Let me draft the incident response system:

```typescript
interface SquirrelIncident {
  rideId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  triggerSource: 'driver_report' | 'bark_detected' | 'camera';
  
  dogReaction: {
    barkIntensity: number;     // 0-10
    attemptedExit: boolean;
    windowContact: boolean;    // Pawing at window
  };
  
  response: {
    treatsDispensed: number;
    calmingMusicPlayed: boolean;
    pulloverRequired: boolean;
  };
  
  outcome: 'resolved' | 'ride_ended_early' | 'escalated';
}

async function handleSquirrelAlert(rideId: string, source: string) {
  // 1. Dispense distraction treat
  await dispenseTreat(rideId, 2, 'squirrel_distraction');
  
  // 2. Start calming music
  await playMusic(rideId, 'calming_classical');
  
  // 3. Log for pattern learning
  await logSquirrelIncident(rideId, source);
  
  // 4. If dog is high-risk (terrier, known squirrel issues)
  const dog = await getDogFromRide(rideId);
  if (dog.flags.includes('squirrel_reactive')) {
    // Deploy window shades
    await notifyDriver(rideId, 'deploy_window_shades');
  }
}
```

---

## Decisions Made

1. Add "Squirrel Alert" button to driver app
2. Auto-dispense treats + calming music on squirrel alert
3. Add squirrel management to driver training
4. Track squirrel incidents for route learning
5. Add "squirrel_reactive" flag to dog profiles

## Follow-up Items

- [ ] David: Update driver training materials
- [ ] Tom: Add Squirrel Alert button to driver app
- [ ] Lisa: Research squirrel-bark detection (v2)
- [ ] Jake: Build squirrel incident logging

## Post-Implementation Update

After 3 weeks:
- Squirrel incidents: 17 → 4 per month
- Exit attempts: 0
- Driver confidence: "Much better with the protocol"
- One driver suggestion: "Add a squirrel emoji to the alert button"
