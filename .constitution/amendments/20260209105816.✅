This article records the constitutional workflow decisions finalized in this session and supersedes the prior ambiguous draft intent.

The article system uses two active states:
- Draft articles use filename state `.📝.md`
- Accepted articles use filename state `.✅.md`

Accepted article content is immutable constitutional truth. Draft article content is editable working material.

Promotion rules:
- A draft article MAY be edited and set to `status: review`.
- A draft article SHALL NOT be manually set to accepted state.
- Acceptance SHALL be performed only through the constitutional acceptance procedure.
- On acceptance, the article is promoted to `.✅.md`.

Operational definitions:
- Constitutional acceptance procedure means running `.constitution/src/scripts/promote_article.py` on a draft article in `status: review` with matching `apply_ok_at`.
- Law reconciliation means updating `.constitution/.law/*.md` to align with current accepted-article truth and restamping `articles_hash`.
- Verification means running `.constitution/src/scripts/verify_kernel_hash.py` and requiring `RESULT=PASS`.

Hash and derivation rules:
- Constitutional article hash SHALL be computed from accepted articles only (`*.✅.md`).
- Article frontmatter SHALL be excluded from hash input.
- Hash input SHALL be the trimmed markdown body.

Law freshness rules:
- Accepting an article SHALL mark all law files stale.
- The next iteration SHALL attempt law reconciliation until verification passes.
- Draft-only edits SHALL NOT affect the accepted-article hash and SHALL NOT force law reconciliation.

Filesystem layout rules:
- `.constitution/.articles/` SHALL store constitutional articles.
- `.constitution/.law/` SHALL store derived law files.
- `.constitution/src/scripts/` SHALL store constitutional procedures and enforcement scripts.
- `.constitution/src/prompts/` SHALL store constitutional agent prompts.
- Draft article records SHALL use filename form `timestamp.📝.md`.
- Accepted article records SHALL use filename form `timestamp.✅.md`.
- Only accepted article records (`*.✅.md`) SHALL participate in constitutional hash computation.

Interaction rules:
- Constitutional policy messages SHALL be phrased in constitutional terms.
- Runtime or tooling identity references SHALL NOT appear in constitutional policy messages.
