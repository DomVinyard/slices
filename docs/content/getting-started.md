# Getting Started

Paste this command into your agent:

```bash
curl -fsSL slices.info/learn | sh
```

This installs Slices to `~/slices` and shows you how to register it with your agent.

## What happens

1. Downloads Slices to your home directory
2. Prints a bootstrap command for your agent's skills directory
3. Your agent can now use Slices for persistent memory
