# Session: Vet Anxiety Problem

## Context

Dogs have learned to recognize vet addresses. When the app predicts "vet" as destination, dogs are refusing to confirm the ride. Vet ride completion rate has dropped to 34%.

---

**Sarah:** We have a vet problem. Dogs are too smart.

**Dr. Patricia Woofson:** I've been analyzing the data. Dogs are showing anticipatory anxiety behaviors when the destination prediction shows the vet. They've learned to associate the app flow with the destination.

**Agent:** Let me look at the ride data.

[Tool: query ride completion by destination type]

```
Destination Type    | Completion Rate
--------------------|----------------
Dog Park            | 97%
Daycare             | 94%
Groomer             | 78%
Friend's House      | 96%
Vet                 | 34%  ← Problem
```

**Agent:** What specific behaviors are you seeing?

**Patricia:** Three patterns:

1. **Pre-boop avoidance** - Dogs see owner open app, walk away from collar
2. **Confirmation refusal** - Dogs boop but won't bark to confirm
3. **Mid-ride anxiety** - Dogs that do go show elevated stress (panting, whining)

**Sarah:** Can we just... not show them it's the vet?

**Agent:** That's actually one approach. "Vet Mode" features:

### Proposed: Vet Mode

**1. Destination Obscuring**
- Don't display destination in collar feedback
- No "Going to Dr. Pawston's!" announcement

**2. Scenic Route**
- Approach vet from different direction than usual
- Prevents "I know this turn" recognition
- Trade-off: Longer ride, more cost

**3. Enhanced Treat Protocol**
- Auto-boost treat budget to 20 for vet rides
- Pre-dispense treats during approach
- Continuous low-rate treats in waiting room

**4. Familiar Driver Preference**
- Match with driver dog has had positive experiences with
- Familiar face = reduced anxiety

**Patricia:** I like the multi-pronged approach. Can we also add calming features?

**Agent:** Yes:

**5. Calming Mode**
- Through-a-Dog's-Ear music (clinically tested)
- Reduced AC fan noise
- Lavender scent diffuser (optional, driver-equipped)

**Sarah:** What about the humans? They need to be able to book vet rides even when the dog won't confirm.

**Agent:** Good point. Add:

**6. Human Override**
- Owner can force-book vet ride without dog confirmation
- Marked as "owner-initiated" in the system
- Dog still gets all the anxiety mitigation features

**Patricia:** One more thing - we should track post-vet wag scores. If the dog had a good experience despite the destination, we want to capture that. It might help with future vet rides.

**Agent:** Agreed. I'll add:

**7. Vet Experience Tracking**
- Separate wag score category for vet visits
- "Post-vet relief" score (usually high)
- Track if dog's vet anxiety decreases over time

## Implementation Plan

```typescript
interface VetModeConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  
  // Destination handling
  hideDestinationFromCollar: boolean;
  useScenicRoute: boolean;
  scenicRouteMaxOverhead: number;  // minutes
  
  // Comfort features
  treatBudgetBoost: number;        // extra treats
  calmingMusicEnabled: boolean;
  preferFamiliarDriver: boolean;
  
  // Override
  allowOwnerForceBook: boolean;
}

// Default vet mode config
const VET_MODE_DEFAULTS: VetModeConfig = {
  enabled: true,
  hideDestinationFromCollar: true,
  useScenicRoute: true,
  scenicRouteMaxOverhead: 10,
  treatBudgetBoost: 10,
  calmingMusicEnabled: true,
  preferFamiliarDriver: true,
  allowOwnerForceBook: true,
};
```

---

## Decisions Made

1. Implement "Vet Mode" with destination obscuring
2. Scenic route option (max 10 min overhead by default)
3. Treat budget auto-boost to 20 for vet rides
4. Owner can force-book without dog confirmation
5. Track vet-specific anxiety metrics over time

## Results (Post-Implementation)

After 2 weeks of Vet Mode:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Vet ride completion | 34% | 67% |
| Avg vet ride wag score | 2.1 | 4.8 |
| Owner satisfaction (vet rides) | 2.3/5 | 4.1/5 |

Dogs are still reluctant, but the experience is much better.
