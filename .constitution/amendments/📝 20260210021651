This amendment supersedes the filename-state model established in 20260209105816 and refined in 20260209222902.

Constitutional files encode state as an emoji prefix on the filename, not as a file extension suffix.

The filename format is: {emoji} {base_name}

Where {emoji} is one of ✅, ⏳, 📝, ❌ and {base_name} is the file's identity (e.g. LAW, .founding, or a timestamp).

Specific filename forms:

(a) Amendments: 📝 {timestamp} (draft), ✅ {timestamp} (accepted).
(b) Founding document: 📝 .founding (draft), ⏳ .founding (under review), ✅ .founding (accepted grundnorm).
(c) Law: ✅ LAW (active), ⏳ LAW (resolving), ❌ LAW (corrupted).

State transitions remain deterministic Path.rename() calls in scripts. The base name is preserved across transitions; only the emoji prefix changes.

Draft amendment records use filename form 📝 {timestamp}. Accepted amendment records use filename form ✅ {timestamp}. Only accepted amendment records (✅ {timestamp}) and ✅ .founding participate in constitutional hash computation.

The founding document is stored in .constitution/amendments/ as ✅ .founding (or ⏳ or 📝 variant). Law is stored in .constitution/ as ✅ LAW (or ⏳ or ❌ variant).

State transition table:
